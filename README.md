# Stock Price Forecasting Project

This repository contains code and data for a stock price forecasting project using ARIMA models.

## Overview

This project aims to forecast stock prices using ARIMA models and visualize the results. It includes:

- Implementation of ARIMA models in Python.
- Analysis and optimization of model parameters.
- Visualization of forecasted stock prices and returns.

## Files

- `stock.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for the project.
- `stored_models.csv`: CSV file storing the best model parameters for each stock ticker.
- `prediction_accuracy.xlsx`: Excel file for comparing predicted and actual stock prices to assess model accuracy.

## How to Use

To view the code and results, open `stock.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Required Python packages (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, nselib)

## Usage

Clone the repository and open `stock.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to explore the code and run the analysis.
